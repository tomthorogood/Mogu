# moguio #

This is a package that contains the bindings for import and export of the [Mogu](http://www.github.com/tomthorogood/Mogu), which is not yet ready for full-scale deployment. However, to ease Mogu's development, the io library has been separated into its own package.

If you are using this, but do not know what Mogu is, you probably downloaded this by mistake.
